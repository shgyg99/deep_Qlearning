# 🎮 Reinforcement Learning AI for Pac-Man

![Pac-Man AI](https://media.giphy.com/media/xT5LMHxhOfscxPfIfm/giphy.gif)

This project implements a **Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent** using **Deep Q-Networks (DQN)** to play the classic **Pac-Man** game. The agent learns to navigate the environment, avoid ghosts, and collect rewards through trial and error. 🚀

## 📌 Features
- 🕹️ Uses **Deep Q-Learning** for training the AI agent
- 🎯 Implements **experience replay** and **epsilon-greedy policy**
- 📊 Tracks rewards and performance over time
- 📂 Fully documented **Jupyter Notebook** for easy experimentation

## 🚀 Installation
Make sure you have Python installed, then run the following commands:

```bash
pip install gym[atari] ale-py autorom
AutoROM --accept-license
pip install torch numpy matplotlib
```

## 🏗️ How to Run
Run the Jupyter Notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook pacman.ipynb
```


## 🎥 Demo
